<b>Overall Feedback</b>

Part 1: Aspect Ratio for ship incorrect! (-1)

Part 2: I like the smooth rotation but there is a bug around +-pi/2 (-0.5) and translation passes right through the mouse position (-0.5)

Note: The smooth rotation does NOT work on windows. It rotates in a circle for the first 15 seconds of the program! (No marks deducted, but could indicate something missed in the code for the future)

<b>Score:</b> 18 / 20 - 90 %
